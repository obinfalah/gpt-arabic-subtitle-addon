# Subtitle Translation Implementation Plan

## Current Status

We've established a stable baseline where subtitles are successfully loading in Stremio using a universal static subtitle file. This approach ensures that subtitles are available for all videos, but they're currently the same content regardless of the video.

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

### Phase 1: Reliable Subtitle Delivery (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Create a universal subtitle endpoint that works for all videos
- ✅ Use direct IP addressing to ensure Stremio can access our subtitles
- ✅ Add proper CORS headers to all subtitle routes
- ✅ Ensure content is served with the correct MIME type

### Phase 2: Dynamic Subtitle Selection
1. Modify the `/subtitles/:mediaId/:subtitleId` route to:
   - Log all incoming requests for analysis
   - Identify patterns in how Stremio requests subtitles
   - Determine which subtitle format works best (VTT vs SRT)

2. Implement a caching system for subtitles:
   - Store subtitles by mediaId
   - Track which subtitles are most frequently requested

3. Create a fallback mechanism:
   - If a specific subtitle isn't available, serve the universal subtitle
   - Log these fallbacks for future improvement

### Phase 3: Real-time Translation
1. Re-implement the translation functionality:
   - Start with a single source language (English)
   - Translate to the user's preferred language
   - Cache translated results

2. Add progress indicators:
   - Show "Translation in progress" while waiting
   - Update with real subtitles once translation is complete

3. Implement background translation:
   - Start translation process when a video is selected
   - Serve translated subtitles when ready

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Multi-source translation:
   - Find the best available subtitle in any language
   - Translate from that language to the user's preferred language

2. Quality improvements:
   - Add timing adjustments for better synchronization
   - Implement formatting preservation

3. User preferences:
   - Allow users to select preferred source languages
   - Add options for translation style (literal vs. conversational)

## Technical Considerations

### URL Structure
- Use consistent URL patterns that Stremio can reliably access
- Ensure all URLs are absolute with direct IP addressing

### Error Handling
- Provide meaningful subtitle content even when errors occur
- Log all errors for analysis and improvement

### Performance
- Cache translations to minimize API calls
- Implement background processing for large subtitle files

## Testing Strategy
1. Test with multiple videos of different types
2. Test with various subtitle formats
3. Test with different network configurations
4. Monitor server logs for any errors or patterns
